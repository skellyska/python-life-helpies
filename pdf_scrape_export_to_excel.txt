Here is a basic Python script that you can use to scrape data from a PDF document and export it to an Excel sheet:
---

import openpyxl
import camelot

# Set the file path of the PDF document
file_path = 'path/to/document.pdf'

# Use camelot to extract the data from the PDF
tables = camelot.read_pdf(file_path)

# Get the first table from the PDF
table = tables[0]

# Convert the table to a list of lists
data = table.data

# Create a new workbook and worksheet
workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()
worksheet = workbook.active

# Loop through the data and write it to the worksheet
for row in data:
    worksheet.append(row)

# Save the workbook
workbook.save('output.xlsx')

---

This script uses the camelot library to extract the data from the PDF and the openpyxl library to create an Excel workbook and write the data to a worksheet.

To use this script, you will need to install the camelot and openpyxl libraries by running the following commands:

---
pip install camelot-py
pip install openpyxl
---
Then, modify the file path in the script to point to the PDF document that you want to scrape, and run the script. 
This will create an Excel workbook called output.xlsx in the same directory as the script, and write the data from the PDF to the worksheet.

Keep in mind that this is just a basic example, and you may need to modify the script to handle more complex PDF documents or
